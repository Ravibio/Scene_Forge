##  Helping me help you

Being in a position of support has taught me how important it is to get adequate information on an issue.
Screenshots, gifs and videos of issues are the best way to help me resolve your issue. By being linked this page I am requesting additional information to assist with a support issue.

> *Without a visual form of recreating the issue all I can do is speculate. Please provide me gifs / videos / images of the issues to help me resolve it as complete and quickly as possible.*

Text descriptions can only go so far and I often ask users for more information so the issues experienced can be recreated and resolved.

## MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING THE LATEST VERSION

Service updates happen post release to fix things reported by active users. Also all the service updates go into the next version. This tool is being worked on round the clock so every few cycles, updates are pushed customer side to ensure things continue to run fluidly.

> *Make sure to have the latest version of Scene Forge anytime a support issue is happening.*

Invalid complaints will be trashed without response. The above goes over what is needed to be assistive. If users can't be assistive in it, then the whole system collapses. I attempt to be proactive in support and development so any and all information is assistive.
