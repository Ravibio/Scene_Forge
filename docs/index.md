# What is Scene Forge?
Scene Forge is a prototyping tool specifically designed to streamline and expedite the process of creating prototype scenes and game environments within the Unity Editor. Drawing from personal experience in game development, the tool offers a range of features that are user-friendly and intuitive, allowing you to quickly and easily build out your game worlds.

By automating many of the labor-intensive tasks involved in prototyping, Scene Forge empowers developers to focus more time and energy on the creative aspects of their projects. With an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency, Scene Forge is an invaluable tool for speeding up the prototyping phase of game development. 

Central to Scene Forge is its unique workflow that facilitates the conversion of blocked-out or simple object scenes, such as those made up of cubes, into polished, finished environments where each basic object is replaced by the model it represents. By automating this process, Scene Forge eliminates the need for developers to manually replace placeholder objects with final assets, saving time and streamlining the scene creation process. This feature enables developers to quickly visualize and iterate on their game environments without getting bogged down in the details, making it an invaluable tool for rapidly prototyping and refining game scenes.

In my personal experience, Scene Forge has been born out of years of manually creating and refining game scenes, involving countless clicks and hours to achieve desired results. My goal with Scene Forge is to provide a tool that minimizes repetitive tasks and simplifies complex processes into straightforward steps. As Unity continues to evolve, I envision Scene Forge evolving alongside it, constantly improving and adapting to meet the needs of developers in creating efficient and visually stunning game environments.
