# Object Presets

Object presets allows you to add your own objects to the **Add menu** (Shift+A). Objects are grouped together by preset name.

# Properties

Adding Object Presets can happen in two ways:

- Pressing **Shift+S** in the scene view and selecting **Object Presets**
- From the toolbar by navigating to **Tools/Scene Forge/Prototyping/Object Preset**

After adding, the object presets will appear in the add menu (Shift+A).



# Requirements

Presets will only appear in the add menu if they have assigned prefabs.
