# Asset Library

The asset library is an inspector window that enables you to select and position low-poly models within your scene. You have the option to either place objects directly in front of the scene view or position them based on your mouse location. Additionally, you can add the prototype component to these objects and integrate them into a prototype collection.

# Properties

You can open/access the asset library from several places.

**1. Toolbar**
Navigate to **Tools/Scene Forge/Prototyping/Asset Library**

**2. Add Menu**
In your scene view press **Shift + A** and select **Asset Library**

**3. Overlay Menu**
To enable this menu in your scene view navigate to the top right corner and enable the **"Add Object"** overlay menu. You can also display the overlays by pressing **( ` )**.
Once enabled an overlay will appear on the left side of the scene view screen from where you can open the asset library.
