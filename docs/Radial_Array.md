# Radial Array

Allows you to create a radial array of objects based on a specified direction. The Radial Array function can be used to duplicate and place objects or elements in a circular pattern, with control over the spacing, number of duplicates, and direction.

# Properties

After selecting a game object from the scene you can use the Radial Array function by pressing **Shift + S** and selecting **Arrays/Line Array**.

Control over the array is done using shortcuts:

- **Scroll Up** is used to increase the object count in the array
- **Scroll Down** is used to decrease the object count in the array
- **Shift + X** is used to cycle the direction of the array. **X  > Y > Z**
- **Enter** is used to confirm the array
- **Esc** is used to cancel the array

# Requirements

Selected object.


# Limitations

Doesn't work for multiple selected objects. To make it work group them all together.
