# Time of Day Presets

Allows to easily change the lighting and atmosphere of your scenes by choosing from a variety of preset options for different times of day. With options like Dawn, Dawn Foggy, Day, Dusk, Night, and Dark Night, you can quickly set the mood and lighting of your scenes to match the desired time of day without having to manually adjust individual lighting settings. This feature is particularly useful for quickly testing your scenes in different lighting. 

# Properties

**Available presets for all pipelines:**

# HDRP

In High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)  the function uses Volumes to achieve the desired effect. Using post processing and physically based sky volume in addition to the HDRI presets of URP and SP.
> *I recommend cloning the volumes to another folder before making any changes to them.*

# URP and SP

Both Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and Standard Pipeline (SP) use HDRIs and sun inside the presets.
